## Introduction
Plant diseases can significantly affect agricultural productivity. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for taking timely action. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify plant diseases from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the PlantVillage dataset. It consists of images of healthy and diseased plants across different categories.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Model Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The final layer uses a softmax activation function for classification.

1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply a number of convolution filters to the input image, helping the model learn spatial hierarchies of features. The first layer uses 32 filters, the second uses 64, and the third also uses 64.

2. **Max-Pooling Layers**: These layers downsample the feature maps, reducing their dimensionality and enabling the model to learn abstract features.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers are responsible for combining all the features learned by the convolutional layers and producing the final output.

## Training
The training process involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training, validation, and test sets, compiling the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function, and then training the model on the training set while validating it on the validation set.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset. The key metrics used for evaluation are accuracy and loss. The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the performance over epochs. This helps in understanding how well the model is learning and generalizing.

## Prediction
The trained model is used to make predictions on new images. The prediction function processes an image, runs it through the model, and returns the predicted class along with the confidence score. This allows for the classification of plant diseases in new, unseen images.

## Experiments and Results
Multiple experiments were conducted to fine-tune the model and improve its performance. The model achieved a training accuracy of approximately 95% and a validation accuracy of approximately 93%. The final test accuracy is around 92%, indicating the model's strong generalization capability on unseen data. The loss values for both training and validation sets decreased over epochs, showing that the model is learning effectively.

Visualizations of the training and validation accuracy and loss were plotted to track the model's performance. The model was able to correctly classify a majority of the test images, with high confidence scores for most predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to accurately classify plant diseases from images. The model shows promising results, with high accuracy and confidence in its predictions. This tool can be beneficial for farmers and agricultural experts in identifying and managing plant diseases early.

Future work could involve expanding the dataset to include more plant species and diseases, improving the model architecture, and integrating the model into a mobile application for real-time disease detection in the field.
